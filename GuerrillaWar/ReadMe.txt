Guerrilla War is intended to be a major reworking of the Tactical and Strategy Layer of XCOM 2, aiming to emphasize the assymetrical warfare implied by the setting.

This playtesting release (0.1.0) has the following changes:

- All missions, except the final 3 plot missions, have infinite reinforcements, so you will be forced to evacuate if you linger too long.

- Corpses must be recovered via a Fulton Extraction (a new item), or carrying them off the battlefield. This probably won't work yet for late game tech such as Gatekeepers or Sectopods.

- That's it, however the two changes above will likely throw the strategy balance all over the place, so that's why I want to release and get playtesting information to help guide future development.

CAUTION:
- Don't play this on ironman without taking backups on campaigns you don't want to lose. Reinforcement Scheduling won't properly reload on save games.

CONFIG:
- Don't like the reinforcement schedules? Create a XComGuerrillaWar.ini file and make some new ones. Look at this mod's ini files for examples.

REPORTING:
Bugs and Balance Complaints will be collected at https://github.com/MalucoMarinero/XCOM2GuerillaWarfare/issues
