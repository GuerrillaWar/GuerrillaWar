## Resistance Camps

The Resistance is activated when XCOM destroys a ADVENT Monument. Once the
resistance is established, the local ADVENT forces will attempt to scout out
with patrols. The Resistance provides local intel, supplies and other support to
XCOM.

### Basic Resistance Operations

Resistance camps can dispatch patrols for two reasons, they improve the local
intel score, and they also act as a potential buffer from ADVENT patrols
stumbling onto the Resistance Camp.
