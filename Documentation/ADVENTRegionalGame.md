# Guerrilla War

## ADVENT Regional Priorities

- **Defense**: Consolidate Garrisons to prevent loss of key strategy assets.
- **Retaliation**: Locate and destroy Resistance Assets.
- **Production**: Produce Forces and Strategy Assets for victor conditions.

## ADVENT Regional Game

ADVENT has City Control Zones in their regional game. Each region will have
one Developed Control Zone, and 2 or 3 Slum control zones. The Developed
Control Zone in a region will be the most heavily garrisoned, and house
strategy critical structures, Gene Clinics, Recruitment Centres and Supply
Centres.

Slum Control Zones are lightly garrisoned, and house Supply Centres.

ADVENT awareness of the Resistance is triggered by Resistance & XCOM Actions.
When they are triggered they begin to divert resources towards discovering and
destroying Resistance forces. In order to do this they dispatch patrols from the
garrisons already established at their City Control Zones.

Patrols must be supported by *Alien Relays*, which can be constructed in Slum
Control Areas (there's no need in the Developed Control Zone). These two
elements, Patrols and Alien Relays, form the basis of ADVENT's intelligence
game.

## The Intelligence Game

Local Intelligence is critical to both ADVENT and the Resistance in discovering
strategic sites so they can send Battallions to destroy them. Both sides have
ways of boosting their *Regional Intel* score, which gives them better scouting
odds for all the assets the enemy has within that region. Different assets have
different thresholds for discovery, so clandestine sites usually require very
high local intel, whereas large mobile battallions are easily discovered with
just a little local presence.

### ADVENT Intel

ADVENT boosts their local intel score by:

- dispatching Patrols within the region
- building Alien Relays within slum zones in the region
- capturing XCOM & Resistance Operatives on missions


Patrols will not boost the local intel score unless they are supported by
Alien Relays, so if we put some non-balanced numbers together, perhaps...

- 1 Alien Relay supports 5 patrols
- 2 Alien Relays supports 10 patrols
- 3 Alien Relays supports 20 patrols

...but the numbers will of course be tweaked over time. When Patrols contribute
to the local intel score, they gain chances to discover Resistance Cells, Data
Relays and Patrols, as well as inserted Operatives.

### Resistance Intel

Resistance boosts their local intel score by:

- dispatching patrols from local cells/havens/HQs
- building Data Relays within Slum Control Zones in the region
- inserting XCOM Operatives to recon Developed Control Zones

Resistance Patrols are supported by cells and data relays. By improving the
local intel score, not only does the Resistance get locations of strategy
assets, but also ongoing scouting information, such as Garrison sizes,
Structures, and observation of movements into and out of structures.

## Patrol Encounters

As well as the passive Intel Bonusses patrols confer, they can also just run
into other strategy assets to discover them on the world map. When encounters
occur between two mobile assets that don't know about one another, they roll for
initiative, which is based on:

- the relative size of the assets (how many troops)
- the disposition of the assets (patrolling, marching, stealth)
- the level of the assets (regular vs elite)

There are three possible results of the initiative check:
- **Resistance Scouts**: The resistance asset discovers the enemy without being
  detected, giving the opportunity to engage from concealment or withdraw.
- **Forced Encounter**: Both assets sight each other and are forced to engage
  without the benefit of concealment, fighting in a balanced position allowing
  for retreat.
- **ADVENT Scouts**: The ADVENT asset discovers the Resistance without being
  spotted. They can engage in ambush or carry on undetected (if they have a more
  important objective). If they engage, battle will start surrounding player
  forces and out of concealment.

## Structure Encounters

Patrols will discover non-mobile strategy assets without being discovered
themselves. They have the choice to then carry on or interact with the site,
although typically the best option will be to hand the mission over to XCOM
proper. ADVENT Patrols have this same capability, if they discover the
Resistance Camp directly it is possible for them to then send Battalions over to
destroy it, without time to prepare.


## Player Involvement in Encounters

Encounters are always auto-resolved unless XCOM has assets in place already at
the encounter. That means the player has no control over Resistance Defense or
Patrol Encounters unless they contribute soldiers to the cause. This is
partially for brevity, partially to reinforce the distinction between the
Resistance and XCOM, the player is XCOM, they support the Resistance with
direction and material, but they are NOT the resistance.

Player forces and loadout are determined by what they've already put in place.
If they dispatched a Patrol lead by an XCOM Operative, that Operative and the
Resistance Fighters that went with them will be the squad for the encounter.

The Avenger + Skyranger is never close enough to intervene. Battles are taken as
given to be immediate contact.

The Skyranger will not be available for encounters, instead evacuation is
performed by travelling to the edge of map.
